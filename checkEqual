/first I wanted to figure out how to compare two numbers 

Input /getting start range from user
Store X /Stores value in AC to location & calls it X
Input /getting end range from user
Store Y /Stores value in AC to location & calls it Y

Subt X /subtracts X from Y (AC<--AC-X) so current value loaded is Y-X 

JnS CheckEqual /stores location of subroutine in location "A" and jumps to "A+1"
Load True /testing to see if we can skip a line based on value
Skipcond 800 /only prints double if numbers are equal (800 = skip if AC>0)
Output
Halt /end prgrm

/SUBROUTINE 
CheckEqual, HEX 000 /need value for flag 
If, Skipcond 400 /If result = 0 then #s are equal
	Jump Equal
/Otherwise result not equal
Else, Load One
	Store True
	Output
	Jump End
Equal, Load Zero
	Store True
	Output
End, JumpI CheckEqual
