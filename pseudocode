I'm fucking pissed cuz I had a draft of code that was almost able to perform exactly what I needed and I swear if I had had like two more hours I could have gotten it
but then I lost all my code cuz marie sucks >:(

for (x in range n){
  if (x > n){
    print Total
    quit 
  }
  else{
    if(checkEven(x)==True){
      total+=x 
    }
    x++
  }
}

checkEven(x){
  if(x%2==0){
    return True 
  }
}


Steps to do program: 

1. Can we divide and produe a remainder?
2. Can we increment a number by 1? 
3. Can we check when one number is bigger than another? / Do we know when we've gone outside a range? 
4. Do we know how to loop through a list of numbers?
5. Do we know how to isolate numbers from a list?
6. Can we combine all these steps to produce a program?
