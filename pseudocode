Steps to do program: 

1. Can we divide and produe a remainder?
2. Can we increment a number by 1? 
3. Can we check when one number is bigger than another? / Do we know when we've gone outside a range? 
4. Do we know how to loop through a list of numbers?
5. Do we know how to isolate numbers from a list?
6. Can we combine all these steps to produce a program?
